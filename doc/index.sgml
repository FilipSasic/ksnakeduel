<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
KTron is a simple Tron-Clone for the
<url url="http://www.kde.org" name="K Desktop Environment">. You can play KTron
against the computer or a friend.
<p>
The aim of the game is to live longer than your opponent. To do that, avoid
running into a wall, your own tail and that of your opponent.


<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KTron 
<p>
KTron is written for the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KTron can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp
site of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KTron, you need the
<tt>KDE libraries</tt> from at least KDE 1.1.
All required libraries as well as KTron itself can be found on
<url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KTron on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the KTron distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Since KTron uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at

<sect>Playing KTron
<p>
<sect1>Rules
<p>
The rules of KTron are very simple. Once a round is started, the player
don´t stop moving forward. All you have to do is avoid crashing by
changing the direction. Additionaly you can try to hinder your opponent.
For this it is possible to accelerate the velocity by pressing your
accelerator key.

A round starts when all human players press a direction key.
The initial moving direction is then this direction.

A game consists of several rounds and ends, if a player has at least nine points
and additionaly two more points than the opponent.
The current score is always displayed in the statusbar.

<sect1>The Computerplayer<label id="sec-computerplayer">
<p>
You can let the computer play player one, player two or both players.
There are three difficulty levels: <bf>Beginner</bf>, <bf>Average</bf> and
<bf>Expert</bf>. If you choose <bf>Beginner</bf>, the computer doesn´t care about
the opponent and just moves around. This is the same algorithm as used by xtron-1.1
. At skill <bf>Average</bf> and <bf>Expert</bf> the computer tries to hinder the
opponent when he comes near.

See section <ref id="config-computerplayer" name="Configuration"> for information how to configure the
computerplayer.


<sect1>Using the keyboard
<p>
Every player has five keys. Four keys for changing the direction and one to
accelerate. You don´t have to press the direction keys all the time. Just
press once, if you want to change the direction of your player. Acceleration is
only activated, if the acceleration key is pressed. When you release the
acceleration key, the velocity slows down to normal.

See section <ref id="sec-keys" name="Key Bindings"> for information how to change
the keys.

<sect1>Pause the game
<p>
If you want to interrupt playing, select "<bf>Pause/Continue</bf>" from the
"<bf>Game</bf>"-menu or hit the keyboard shortcut (see section
<ref id="sec-keys" name="Key Bindings"> ).
Additionaly the game is paused when the game looses the keyboard focus, e.g.
when switching to an other window.

If you want to continue the game, use again the menuentry
"<bf>Pause/Continue</bf>" or the keyboard shortcut. If all human players
press one of their direction keys, the game continues, too. But be careful,
your player switches to this direction immediately.
