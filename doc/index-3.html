<H3><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Rules</A>
</H3>

<P>The rules of KTron are very simple. Once a round is started, the player
don´t stop moving forward. All you have to do is avoid crashing by
changing the direction. Additionaly you can try to hinder your opponent.
For this it is possible to accelerate the velocity by pressing your
accelerator key.
<P>A round starts when all human players press a direction key.
The initial moving direction is then this direction.
<P>A game consists of several rounds and ends, if a player has at least nine points
and additionaly two more points than the opponent.
The current score is always displayed in the statusbar.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sec-computerplayer"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 The Computerplayer</A>
</H3>

<P>You can let the computer play player one, player two or both players.
There are three difficulty levels: <B>Beginner</B>, <B>Average</B> and
<B>Expert</B>. If you choose <B>Beginner</B>, the computer doesn´t care about
the opponent and just moves around. This is the same algorithm as used by xtron-1.1
. At skill <B>Average</B> and <B>Expert</B> the computer tries to hinder the
opponent when he comes near.
<P>See section 
<A HREF="index-4.html#config-computerplayer">Configuration</A> for information how to configure the
computerplayer.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Using the keyboard</A>
</H3>

<P>Every player has five keys. Four keys for changing the direction and one to
accelerate. You don´t have to press the direction keys all the time. Just
press once, if you want to change the direction of your player. Acceleration is
only activated, if the acceleration key is pressed. When you release the
acceleration key, the velocity slows down to normal.
<P>See section 
<A HREF="index-4.html#sec-keys">Key Bindings</A> for information how to change
the keys.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Pause the game</A>
</H3>

<P>If you want to interrupt playing, select "<B>Pause/Continue</B>" from the
"<B>Game</B>"-menu or hit the keyboard shortcut (see section
<A HREF="index-4.html#sec-keys">Key Bindings</A> ).
Additionaly the game is paused when the game looses the keyboard focus, e.g.
when switching to an other window.
<P>If you want to continue the game, use again the menuentry
"<B>Pause/Continue</B>" or the keyboard shortcut. If all human players
press one of their direction keys, the game continues, too. But be careful,
your player switches to this direction immediately.
